## 🧩 Philosophy

At Meforgers, we believe that:

- AI systems must be **foundational, not superficial**
- Performance requires **tight integration of software and hardware**
- Infrastructure diversity is a strength, not a limitation
- Security is not an add-on — it is a requirement

We build technology at the **intersection of research, engineering, and real-world systems**.
